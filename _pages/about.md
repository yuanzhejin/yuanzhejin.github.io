Welcome to Yuanzhe Jin's Homepage! 
======
I am a final-year Ph.D. student majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Oxford, working as a postgraduate research assistant at the Oxford e-Research Centre [(OeRC)](https://oerc.ox.ac.uk/) with Professor [Min Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/mchen). My current work focuses on quality assurance in machine learning applications, which combines human and machine strengths in the machine learning model training and testing process. 

My research interests include: 
 * Data Visualization
 * Intelligent User Interface
 * Machine Learning Model Quality Assurance
 * Biomedical Data Analysis

I am honored to be in the Network of European Data Scientists[(NeEDS)](https://riseneeds.eu/secondments/previous-secondments-university-of-oxford/yuanzhe-jin-at-centraal-bureau-voor-de-statistiek/) project and collaborate with Statistics Netherlands, Inetum Spain, and Inria.
